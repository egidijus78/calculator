<h2 align="center"> Calculator project </h2>

<h4> This is my first step trying to program in Python. The project was conceived as learning and testing the possibilities of tkinter package as part of Python and its functionality. The idea of this project was to create a transparent graphic calculator, unfortunately tkinter does not provide the ability to make function keys transparent, it's not meant for that. So I had to compromise, I made the calculator screen frame and background transparent and functional parts with a permanent color.</h4>

<h4> I tried what else can be added to this calculator, I added a combobox with the ability to change background color and added eleven colors.

<h4> I have added a digital clock with date, day of the week, month.</h4>

<h4> I also added the weather forecast for now in my city Vilnius. Unfortunately the screen of the calculator and window itself ar not able to place extensive information about the weather and other parameters. </h4>

<h4> I also added a window at the bottom of the window with the ability to enter text as notes. </h4>
